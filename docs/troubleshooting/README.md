Hit something weird? **Scan the symptom table**, jump to the entry, apply the fix. If you
solve a *new* problem — especially one that took more than a few minutes or that we're likely
to hit again — **add it here** while it's fresh (template at the bottom).

## 🔎 Quick lookup

| # | Symptom | Likely cause | Jump |
|:--|:---|:---|:--|
| 1 | Backend crash-loops on startup with an opaque `[Object: null prototype] {}` uncaught exception | `ts-node` can't parse the installed TypeScript version | [→](#1-backend-crash-loops-with-object-null-prototype) |
| 2 | Dashboard shows no tasks / `403 Invalid or expired token`; agent handshake rejected | Docker's default secrets don't match your rotated `backend/.env` | [→](#2-403-invalid-or-expired-token-or-agent-rejected) |
| 3 | Port 3000 shows as `LISTENING` but every request returns `HTTP 000` / `EADDRINUSE` on restart | Docker's port proxy holds the port even though the app process died | [→](#3-port-listening-but-http-000--eaddrinuse) |

## 1. Backend crash-loops with `[Object: null prototype]`

**Symptom** — `docker logs taskhub-backend-1` (or `npm run dev` in `backend/`) prints a bare
uncaught exception and exits, restarting forever:

```
node:internal/modules/run_main:123
    triggerUncaughtException(
[Object: null prototype] {
  [Symbol(nodejs.util.inspect.custom)]: [Function: [nodejs.util.inspect.custom]]
}
Failed running 'src/index.ts'
```

The compiled build (`npm run build` then `npm start`) runs **fine** — which is the tell.

**Cause** — the dev runner was `ts-node`, and `ts-node@10.9` does not support TypeScript 6.
It throws that opaque null-prototype object instead of a readable error. Plain `tsc` +
`node dist/index.js` never touches ts-node, so the compiled path works and masks the cause.

**Fix** — run dev/seed through **`tsx`** (version-agnostic), not ts-node. This is already the
committed default:

```jsonc
// backend/package.json
"dev":  "tsx watch src/index.ts",
"seed": "tsx src/seed.ts",
```

If the Docker container still fails after a `package.json` change, its anonymous
`node_modules` volume is shadowing the fresh image — rebuild **and** renew it:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes backend
```

> [!TIP]
> Any bare `[Object: null prototype]` crash from a TS entrypoint is almost always the dev
> **runner**, not your code or your env. Confirm by building: if `npm run build && npm start`
> works, it's the runner.

## 2. `403 Invalid or expired token` (or agent rejected)

**Symptom** — the stack is up, but the dashboard shows no tasks and API calls return
`403 {"error":"Invalid or expired token"}`. Or the agent connects and is immediately
rejected at the pairing handshake.

**Cause** — `docker-compose.yml` bakes in **DEV-ONLY default secrets**
(`JWT_SECRET=dev-jwt-secret-change-in-production`, and defaults for `ENCRYPTION_KEY` /
`AGENT_PAIRING_SECRET`) so `docker compose up` boots out of the box. But the frontend dev
token in `frontend/.env.local` and the agent's `TASKHUB_PAIRING_SECRET` were generated
against the **rotated** secrets in `backend/.env`. The container's default `JWT_SECRET`
can't verify a token signed with the rotated one → 403. Same story for the pairing secret.

**Fix** — create a **root `.env`** (next to `docker-compose.yml`, gitignored) mirroring the
secret values from `backend/.env`. Compose interpolates it automatically:

```dotenv
JWT_SECRET=<same as backend/.env>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<same as backend/.env, exactly 32 chars>
AGENT_PAIRING_SECRET=<same as backend/.env>
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
```

Then recreate the backend so it loads the new env (env changes need a recreate, not just a
rebuild):

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate backend
```

**Verify** — `docker exec taskhub-backend-1 printenv JWT_SECRET` should now show your
`backend/.env` value, and `GET /api/tasks` with the dev token returns `200`.

> [!NOTE]
> Whenever you rotate a secret in `backend/.env`, update the root `.env` too, and regenerate
> the frontend dev token (`frontend/.env.local`). See
> [Setup › Docker vs. manual](../setup/README.md#-docker-vs-manual).

## 3. Port `LISTENING` but `HTTP 000` / `EADDRINUSE`

**Symptom** — `netstat` shows `:3000` as `LISTENING`, but `curl http://localhost:3000/...`
returns `HTTP 000` (connection made, no response). Or starting the backend locally fails
with `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`.

**Cause** — Docker's port proxy (`com.docker.backend`) keeps the published port bound to the
container **even while the app process inside it has crashed or is mid-restart**. So the port
looks alive, but nothing answers — and a *second* local process can't bind it either.

**Fix** — don't chase the port; check the app. Read `docker logs taskhub-backend-1` to see
why the process died (usually entry #1 or #2 above). To run the backend locally instead of in
Docker, stop the container first so the proxy releases the port:

```bash
docker compose stop backend
cd backend && npm run dev
```

> [!TIP]
> `HTTP 000` from `curl` means "connected but got nothing," which points at a **crashed app
> behind a live proxy**, not a firewall or a wrong URL.

## ➕ Adding a new entry

Keep it short and greppable. For each problem, capture:

1. **Symptom** — the exact error text / observable behavior (so it's searchable).
2. **Cause** — the underlying reason, and any "tell" that distinguishes it.
3. **Fix** — the concrete commands/edits that resolved it.
4. Add a row to the **Quick lookup** table and date it (`*First hit: YYYY-MM-DD.*`).
